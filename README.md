# Similar Item Detection in Amazon Book Reviews

This repository contains the project developed for the Algorithms for Massive Data module, part of the Master in Data Science for Economics at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.
The goal of the project is to identify similar book reviews based on their textual content. Two approaches are implemented and compared:
- Exact similarity using Jaccard index (brute-force)
- Approximate similarity using MinHash and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

Contents:
- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook (fully executable on Colab)
- `report.pdf`: Project report written in LaTeX

Dataset:
The dataset used is the [Amazon Books Review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews) from Kaggle. A subset of 1000 reviews was sampled and processed.
